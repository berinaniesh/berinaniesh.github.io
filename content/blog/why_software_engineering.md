## Introduction

If anyone has read my [about page](/about), they would know that I have a master's degree in nuclear engineering and a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering and yet I chose software engineering as my career path. Some people, especially my parents just can't wrap their heads around this fact and whenever they ask me why I chose this field, I find it really hard to explain to them in a few words. This blog post attempts to answer that question once and for all.

## Short Answer

[I liked it](/ilikeit.jpg)

As simple as that.

Maybe I am not as good with code as Heisenberg was in cooking meth, but I can write something useful for sure.

Each person gets satisfaction from something. Walter White got it from cooking meth and many of us get it from writing code. But there are many other factors as well. Let me explain.

## Build Anything

Imagine a world where we can get all the design documents, the manufacturing procedure and all required tools and machinery to build an F1 car. Imagine all the hard work and engineering effort put by thousands of engineers available for free for us to study and create a perfect replica or even a better F1 car. Wouldn't that be awesome? Isn't that what all open source software provide us? Take the Linux Kernel for example. All those millions of lines of code, the hard work of all those engineers available for free for us to study. The same can be said for the hundreds of thousands of Open Source Software projects available with free licenses.

Whatever we want to build, we have resources openly available. All we need to do is put in the effort.

### Is an F1 car equivalent to the linux kernel?

This is something many people, especially the non tech savy older folks ask me. "How can an F1 car be compared to some piece of software? The F1 car and its technology is much more sophisticated" they say.

I acutally get this line of thought. Seeing something physical and material feels worthy. I used to be a person who would buy a motorcycle for 4 lakhs INR (approx 5000 USD, which is a lot here) but would think thrice before buying a music player app from the play store for 80 INR (1 USD). Things have infact changed now. 

I would say it is all perspective. Building both of them require intelligence. If anyone has worked with car engines they would know the level of sophistication requried to fire those cylinders. A four cylinder engine at 6000 rpm fires at a rate of 200Hz. That's 200 strokes per second. When we think at human scales, it is a magnificient figure. I can very well see that.

But a computer running at 3GHz has 3000000000 cycles per second and the linux kernel is designed for those speeds (to put in crude terms, sorry technical folks). Does that mean the linux kernel is harder to engineer than an F1 engine? I wouldn't say that also. But I would definitely say one field is not inferior to another.

## Building everything with the mind

When I learnt to write code, I thought binary trees / binary search is one of the most intelligent things software engineering folks have designed. Then later I realized it is one of the thousands of algorithms people design and use everyday. Once we dive into any significant software, we really can see the intelligence of people who designed that thing. That really excites me. Even if a Boeing engineer did something very creative and intelligent that improved some part of the aircraft many folds, I don't think many people would know that. Seeing some of the unthinkable problems being reduced to simple steps and solved through graphs is one of the most satisfying experiences one can ever have.

## Competing / Grinding
Maybe it is just me, but the field of programming / software engineering feels more competitive than any other fields. Let me give an example. Let's talk about two engineers at Boeing and Airbus respectively. They are of the same age / experience. They both work for respected companies and they contribute meaningfully to their jobs. How do you measure who is a better engineer? Maybe they have personal projects of miniature aircraft parts? I understand not everything is about a competition, but if we have two software engineers, we can look at the number of github stars earned or their rating on codeforces or their rank at kaggle or their points at stackoverflow. Maybe they are not the perfect indicators of the competence of an engineer, but those numbers mean atleast something. 

There are so many ways to grind and get noticed. We can grind at codeforces and become red, or grind at stackoverflow and get a 100K points. Maybe, we can build significant projects and develop a business. There just seems to be a lot of ways to prove ourselves, which I like a lot. Our value is not based on experience or the previous job, but by our competence.

Other than these ways of competing, there are so many competitions with prizes held on various websites, in which we again can prove ourselves. I really like this aspect of software engineering. I think it makes us all better software engineers. 


## Low barrier to entry

Like in the previous sections, let's imagine a world where Mercedes' F1 car's engine design documents and specifications are openly available. They have given us the permission to use the designs in any way we desire. Can build an engine, with all those information? We probably can't because building engines requires proper metals mined from the earth, alloyed in careful proportions, cast into engine blocks (with huge machinery), machined to laser thin precision (again with huge machinery) and the list goes on.

Think of that in terms of software, say the linux kernel again. All we need is a computer. We still need different types of software and all kinds of design goes into designing each part, but still all we need is a computer.

With the thousands of free tutorials out there, one can learn anything. One can contact an expert of any domain and get help through the numerous help forums or chat servers.

I want to learn to build a game engine - there are tutorials for that

I want to learn to build a chess engine - there are tutorials for that

I want to learn to build an ecommerce websites - there are tutorials for that.

With the barrier to entry so low and an infinite learning curve, software engineering provides endless opportunities for anyone with any level of expertise.

With respect to competing, I am aware there are other competitions (if one can call them that) like Pulitzer prizes, Nobel prizes, publishing in great journals, etc., but again, the barrier to entry in all those is very high. And a small group judges the work. Eventhough this is a double edged sword, I think public judging is much better (maybe due to the miracle of aggregation?). So even in terms of competing, the barrier to entry is so low in software engineering. 

## A useful skill in the 21st century

Once one learn to talk to computers through code, it really does open a lot of opportunities. It saves time and makes our lives much easier.
It becomes so easy to communicate one's mind to many people (like I'm doing here). 

Let me give a simple example of saving time. Lets say we need music to play in the car during a family trip. Each person wants a different song. We can ask everyone in the family to add their favorite songs to a google docs document. Now we have a list of songs that we have to download / buy / create a playlist. A person with no programming skills might sit in front of a PC, manually search for each song, buy it or manually create a spotify playlist. One can do it for 10 songs, say 100 songs, but what if the number of songs is a 1000? A much easier way is to use youtube-dl in a python script to download all songs in one go (if the music's license permits that) or use the Spotify API to create a playlist programatically, which could save hours.

With many people spending so much time in front of computers, knowing to talk to computers is an invaluable skill.

Now with all the shiny stuff out of the way, let us also see why one should not choose software engineering

## Why not to choose Software Engineering
The biggest reason I can think of is the initial few months for a person who barely understands what is going on. It is painful. Some people are really illiterate when it comes to computers. Let me share a small story.

Once, I was compiling something big when a friend of mine asked the laptop to check her email. She clicked on the chrome icon and it took a few moments to open. She uses a MacBook and she knows for a fact that Windows is slower. She was like "You know what you should do? Press Win+r, enter %temp% and delete everything in there and your computer will be fast." I was running linux at that moment. I said "Sure, thanks for the help. I will do that once the system responds". I mean, she is a good at what she does. She doesn't need computers. If she needs something done, she can pay someone to do it for her. It really will take a lot of time for her to understand the working of computers. For such people, probably learning to code is not such a great idea. But for everyone else, I think it is a very useful skill to have.

## Conclusion

I think I have answered the question I get asked numerous time to some level of satisfaction here. I enjoyed writing it and I hope you enjoyed reading it as well. If you have any comments feel free to [email](mailto:berinaniesh@gmail.com) me. I'll be happy to hear your thoughts.

Cheers! 

Have a good day!
